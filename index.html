            I am Joshua Carter. I am the younger, more athletic, and beautiful of the two Carter kids. My name was actually going to be Jeremy, but it was changed and boy am I happy about that.
            My middle name is also Raymond, the name of my uncle and grandfather.
            I am at least African American, but there are so many races mixed in me it is borderline impossible to trace.
            I get my musical side from my father and my stubbornness from my mother. I am also a Christian and an athlete although I could do better in both.
            People always say that I look like my father or my other uncle Todd, but in my opinion I look weirdly like my mother. 
            Anyways, I was born in New Jersey and lived here my whole life. I used to go to a private school, but being the only black kid and smartest boy in a friend group gets tiring. 
            I was always jealous of my sister because of the way she talked about Teaneck High, so I decided I wanted to go. I switched to Benjamin Franklin Middle School in the seventh grade and I was not disappointed.
            Thanks to BFMS I can say I face more challenges than when I was at my other school. There are people who look like me, boys who are actually smart, and way more freedom. I would not change a thing about my life.

                If it wasnt obvious, I play the drums. I have been playing the drums
                for almost 7 years now. I am in my schools concert and marching band(bcause we don't get a chance), but I enjoy it fully.
                I also like to read books, usually sci-fi, but I havent found a good read lately. I play video games most of the time ranging from games like NBA2k to Rainbow Six Seige.
                I would say that my favorite activity has to be eating tho. And yes I put this in my activities section because that's how much I love eating.
                And thanks to my fast metabolism I don't have to worry about gaining weight. I also do Track and Field, mostly field, and have been ranked high in the state in past years.
                The events I do are discus, javelin, long-jump,triple-jump, and the 400 meter dash, but I have occasionally done shotput and the 800.
                All and all, I always have something to do and have a lot of achievements to show for it.
