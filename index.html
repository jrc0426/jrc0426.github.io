            I am Joshua Carter. I am the younger, more athletic, and beautiful of the two Carter kids. My name was actually going to be Jeremy, but it was changed and boy am I happy about that.
            My middle name is also Raymond, the name of my uncle and grandfather.
            I am at least African American, but there are so many races mixed in me it is borderline impossible to trace.
            I get my musical side from my father and my stubbornness from my mother. I am also a Christian and an athlete although I could do better in both.
            People always say that I look like my father or my other uncle Todd, but in my opinion I look weirdly like my mother. 
            Anyways, I was born in New Jersey and lived here my whole life. I used to go to a private school, but being the only black kid and smartest boy in a friend group gets tiring. 
            I was always jealous of my sister because of the way she talked about Teaneck High, so I decided I wanted to go. I switched to Benjamin Franklin Middle School in the seventh grade and I was not disappointed.
            Thanks to BFMS I can say I face more challenges than when I was at my other school. There are people who look like me, boys who are actually smart, and way more freedom. I would not change a thing about my life.

                If it wasnt obvious, I play the drums. I have been playing the drums
                for almost 7 years now. I am in my schools concert and marching band(because we don't get a choice), but I enjoy it fully.
                I also like to read books, usually sci-fi, but I havent found a good read lately. I play video games most of the time ranging from games like NBA2k to Rainbow Six Seige.
                I would say that my favorite activity has to be eating tho. And yes I put this in my activities section because that's how much I love eating.
                And thanks to my fast metabolism I don't have to worry about gaining weight. I also do Track and Field, mostly field, and have been ranked high in the state in past years.
                The events I do are discus, javelin, long-jump,triple-jump, and the 400 meter dash, but I have occasionally done shotput and the 800.
                I also like to go riding around the park on my bicycle with my friends or play basketball with them.
                None of us are really good, so it always makes the game pretty fun.
                All and all, I always have something to do and have a lot of achievements to show for it.

                    <h4>Academic:</h4>I have been getting Principal's Honor Roll since the fifth grade every single marking period. I waas awarded an academic achievement award with a signature from the president.
                        I was inducted into my schools National Junior Honor Society. I was the "valedictorian"(not exactly what we callled it) at my middle school. I am in an advanced program in my high school<br>
                        <h4>Athletics:</h4>I have been ranked top 16 nationally for discus. Last year, in the state of New Jersey, I was first in triple jump, second in discus, and third in long jump for AAU. 
                        I have gone and competed in the AAU Junior Olympics for the past five years. I was one of the top scorers for my track team freshmen year. I was given MVP on my team freshmen year.
